    <h2>What's Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.<br>Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for <br>Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting<br>or glue language to connect existing components together. <br>Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore<br>reduces the cost of program maintenance.<br>Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.<br>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
    <p>Python v3 was created in December 3, 2008. Its original developer is Guido van Rossum, Dutch programmer.</p>
